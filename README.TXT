2.  Installation software for most of the packages used (windows/Win95)
	a.  GhostView (to view PostScript files)
	b.  Maple 5 (to fortan optimize the derivative code)
	c.  MathCAD (for preliminary prototyping)
	d.  Mathematica (for computation of the derivatives)
	e.  MatLab (for testing data structures / linear algebra)
	f.  Scientific WorkPlace (for generating the LaTex paper)
	g.  Sigma Plot (for rendering data ---> graphs)
	h.  Surfer (for Potential Energy Surface work)

AUTHOR's TIPS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Some of this is pretty messy and could take some time to sort
	through.  Sorry-- but I don't have the time at present to
	clean all of this up.  The GOOD NEWS is that it is ALL HERE!
	If you have the patience to go looking for it-- it is
	somewhere on this CD.

	There are several different versions of the H2 Project program
	at various stages of development.  First there was Zhang's
	code (poorly written & had to be done over... but contained
	some useful things).  Then came the prototyping in "H2PROJ".
	The "Latest & Greatest" version (the version that generated
	the preliminary results for the paper) is contained in
	"CGAUSS".
