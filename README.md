# H2 Correlated GG Project

## What This Distribution Contains

1. All work product related to the H2 Correlated GG Project:
   - **Fortran77 Code**
   - **Fortran90 Code**
   - **Mathematica Files** for the derivatives
   - **Sigma Plot Files** of compiled data

   - **Maple 5** (to Fortran optimize the derivative code)
   - **MathCAD** (for preliminary prototyping)
   - **Mathematica** (for computation of the derivatives)
   - **MatLab** (for testing data structures / linear algebra)
   - **Scientific WorkPlace** (for generating the LaTeX paper)
   - **Sigma Plot** (for rendering data into graphs)
   - **Surfer** (for Potential Energy Surface work)
   - **Winzip** (to compress/decompress files for archiving)

## Development History

There were several different versions of the H2 Project program at various stages of development. Initially, there was Zhang's code, then came prototyping in "H2PROJ". The latest version (generating the preliminary results for the paper) is contained in "CGAUSS".
